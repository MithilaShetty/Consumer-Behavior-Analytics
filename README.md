It applies clustering to uncover consumer segments, decision trees to classify campaign responses, and regression models to estimate total monetary value. The goal is to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing and revenue optimization.

## Documentation

The comprehensive documentation for this and two other projects is available in the file:
